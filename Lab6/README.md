## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

<!-- Put your answer to question 1 here -->
> #1 Give moderators the ability to delete messages and rooms. Sometimes messages and room names may be inappropriate, so it would be useful to delete messages from the frontend rather than manually doing it from mongoDB.
> #2 Give users the ability to filter the messages or rooms by their names. It would be helpful to filter messages and room names so the user can view or access them with convenience.
